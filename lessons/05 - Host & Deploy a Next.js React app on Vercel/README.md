# ðŸ““ Lesson 05: Host & Deploy a Next.js React app on Vercel

In order for someone to buy your products, your store needs to be publicly available.

Vercel is a hosting and deployment solution that works perfectly with Next.jsâ€”they're the ones who made it! We can use Vercel to easily deploy our site from GitHub and automatically update our store any time we add any changes.

## Getting Started

In lesson 5, we'll walk through what actually happens when Next.js builds a project.

Once we we have that down, we'll first set up our project on GitHub and follow up by importing that project to Vercel, allowing us to host and deploy our app to the world.

Finally, once deployed, we'll learn what happens when we make a change and how we can update our app on the web.

## Objectives
* Review what happens when Next.js builds a project
* Add a Next.js project to GitHub
* Import a GitHub project into Vercel
* Understand how changes trigger new deploys

## Exercises

>
> For this lesson, we'll be working inside of GitHub and Vercel. There will be no code changes for these exercises. If you haven't already created a GitHub or Vercel accounts, now is the time to get those set up.
