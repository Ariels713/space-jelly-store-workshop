# Lesson 02: Add a Grid of Products with Images to a Next.js React App

The core of any shopping experience is simply being able to see what the store has to offer! This includes what products are available and how much each one of them costs.

While we can do this in a variety of ways, a common way is to show a grid of products where we can see everything the store has to offer (or a lot of it). Using some HTML and CSS, we can create our product grid allowing our customers a look into our store.

## Getting Started

For our second lesson, we're going to put together a product grid using some HTML and CSS.

We'll start off by updating the default Next.js template to include our products instead of links to the Next.js docs. Then, we'll import some images for our products that will already be available in this lesson folder so we can show what our products look like. Finally, we'll make some basic CSS changes to the default Next.js template to make sure we're providing a good experience to our customers.

## Objectives
* Add products to the app
* Import product images and add to each product
* Update the default page styles
