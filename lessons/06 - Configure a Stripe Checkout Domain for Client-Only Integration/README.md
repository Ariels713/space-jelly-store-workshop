# ðŸ““ Lesson 06: Configure a Stripe Checkout Domain for Client-Only Integration

Stripe has a variety of solutions that makes it super powerful as a payment provider. We're taking advantage of their Stripe Checkout product because it allows us to get started with an online store without having to manually accept payments.
