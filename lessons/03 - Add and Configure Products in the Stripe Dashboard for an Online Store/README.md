# Lesson 03: Add and Configure Products in the Stripe Dashboard for an Online Store

Part of any ecommerce store starts with what you're trying to sell: the products.

Stripe has a lot of services to give you flexibility as a store manager and that starts with a management tool right in it's dashboard to add and manage the products of your store.

## Getting Started

For lesson 3, we'll be getting ourselves familiar with the Stripe dashboard and setting up our first products inside of Stripe.

We'll learn where we can find the product management page and actually add new products to Stripe. We'll then configure those products with the same details we used in [Lesson 02](https://github.com/colbyfayock/space-jelly-store-workshop/tree/main/lessons/02%20-%20Add%20a%20Grid%20of%20Products%20with%20Images%20to%20a%20Next.js%20React%20App) including the images and title.
